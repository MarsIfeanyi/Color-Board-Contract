a board has 35 cells, each locatable by its respective x and y axis, your job is to respresent this in solidity(using your preferred data structure). Each cell can only be filled with either

white i.e no color === id 1
black ==== id 2
red ==== id 3
black ==== id 4

these id's should be representable onchain such that if i query what is in

x axis = 1,2
y axis = 3,4

it should return the color in that cell

You have 48 hours in total to finish this

P.S Build a UI for your implemetation and get 20usdc
